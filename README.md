# Matrix-direct-product-method
## A method to hand-eye calibration
Using matrix direct product method to estimate external calibration between two trajectories obtained by two diffenent sensors. And using non-linear optimization method to optimize the result. 
## How to build
mkdir build   
cd build  
cmake ..  
make
